    question: 'What type of 3D printing do you offer?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        We specialize in Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), a reliable and cost-effective method for producing strong, functional parts. This technique builds objects layer by layer using thermoplastic filaments, allowing for excellent material versatility and geometric precision.
      </p>
    )
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do you use the term FFF instead of FDM?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>We use the term FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) to describe our 3D printing process because it is the technically correct and industry-neutral term for this type of additive manufacturing.</p>
        <p>While FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) is more widely recognized, it is a trademarked term owned by Stratasys, a large industrial 3D printing company. In contrast, FFF was introduced by the open-source community to describe the same layer-by-layer thermoplastic extrusion process without infringing on proprietary branding.</p>
        <p>Both terms refer to the exact same technology—a heated nozzle melts a plastic filament and deposits it in successive layers to build up a 3D object. However, using "FFF" allows us to maintain clarity, transparency, and independence in our services, especially in a market that includes both commercial and open-source platforms.</p>
        <p>At Exact 3D Design, we prioritize clear communication and open accessibility, which is why we use the more accurate and universally accepted term Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF).</p>

    question: 'Which materials do you support?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>PLA:</strong> Great for general-purpose prototypes. Rigid, easy to print, and biodegradable.</li>
          <li><strong>PETG:</strong> Strong, water-resistant, and less brittle than PLA.</li>
          <li><strong>ASA:</strong> UV-resistant, weatherable, and ideal for outdoor parts.</li>
          <li><strong>ABS:</strong> Durable and impact-resistant, suited for mechanical use.</li>
          <li><strong>ABS-ESD:</strong> Electrically static-dissipative ABS for use around sensitive electronics.</li>
          <li><strong>ABS-CF:</strong> Increased stiffness and thermal resistance over standard ABS.</li>
          <li><strong>PA6-CF / PA6-GF:</strong> Excellent strength, fatigue resistance, and thermal stability.</li>
          <li><strong>PA12-CF / PA12-GF:</strong> Low moisture absorption and exceptional chemical resistance.</li>
          <li><strong>PPA-CF:</strong> Extremely rigid and heat-resistant, designed for demanding applications.</li>
          <li><strong>PP-G30:</strong> Lightweight, chemically resistant, perfect for automotive or marine use.</li>
          <li><strong>TPU 95A:</strong> Durable and flexible—ideal for seals, gaskets, and enclosures.</li>
          <li><strong>TPU 82A / 80A:</strong> Softer and more elastic grades, great for wearables or grips.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you’re unsure which material is right for your application, we’re happy to provide guidance based on your specific performance requirements.</p>

    question: 'What is the maximum print size you can accommodate?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        We can produce parts up to 256mm x 256mm x 256mm in a single build. Larger items can be printed in sections and joined using advanced bonding techniques for structural integrity.

  {
    question: 'Can you help with 3D design or reverse engineering?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Absolutely. Whether you have a hand-drawn sketch, a physical object to replicate, or just a concept in mind, our team can provide full CAD design services and reverse engineering using digital calipers and high-resolution scanning. Files are provided in standard formats like STL, STEP, and 3MF.
